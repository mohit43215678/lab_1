# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in Python.

## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a great way to pass your time if you're looking for a quick, fun game.

## Implementation

This version of the game is implemented in Python and uses functions to organize the game logic. This makes the code more readable and maintainable. The game alternates between two players, checks for a winner after each move, and ends when a player wins or the board is full. If a move is invalid, it asks the player to try again.

## How to Run

To play the game, simply run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script in Python.

Enjoy the game!
